### About SameSite cookies and Chrome: ###

With recent changes to Google Chrome, cookies are now defaulted to SameSite=Lax. This may cause issues when attempting to send cookies to an external site.

This addon can resolve issues where offsite cookies are required, such as offsite payment gateways and with 3D Secure.
